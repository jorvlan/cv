#You can print HTML pages to PDF using Google Chrome or Chromium using the menu “Print” or by pressing Ctrl #+ P (or Command + P on macOS). Remember to allow background graphics to be printed. You may also consider #using the function pagedown::chrome_print(), but currently it is experimental and you may get an incomplete #PDF, so we re‑commend that you open the page in a real browser and print to PDF there instead (https://pagedown.rbind.io/#print-to-pdf)
